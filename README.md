# Graph-Coverage
Graph coverage is important in testing as it helps ensure that all paths and relationships within a graph-based system are exercised. It reveals hidden defects, improves test effectiveness, and enhances overall system reliability.


This repository is about graph coverage for a certain Java code. This file description contains:

All nodes (comma-separated) mentioning the start and end nodes, test paths for node coverage with a test case for each path.
All edges (comma-separated), test paths for edge coverage with a test case for each path.
Prime path coverage with a test case for each path.
PDF screenshot of the graph."
and the java code is attached.
